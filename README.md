# global-satellite-twinfield-qkd
Simulation framework for global satellite TF-QKD with distributed trust. Models realistic ISL/UL channels, orbital dynamics, noise, and finite-key effects. Graph-based routing with XOR forwarding evaluates multi-path SKR, outages, and global key throughput over month-long cycles.
